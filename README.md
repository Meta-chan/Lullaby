# Welcome to Lullaby!
 A program transmitting and receiving messages using speakers and microphone! Like SSTV, but more general, not restricted with images only. Want to hear some awkward beeping? You are in the right repo!

### Dependencies
 Lullaby depends on [Ironic Library](https://github.com/Meta-chan/ironic_library) and [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org). In future may be ported to [BASS](http://www.un4seen.com).
	
### Platforms
 Developed and tested under Windows x86, but in perspective can be ported to every platform supported by [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org).

###### P.S. My code is not dirty, it is alternatively clean.
